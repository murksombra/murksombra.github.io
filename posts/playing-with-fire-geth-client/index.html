      <p>Here am I once again.. This time, my night thoughts lead me to a very simple rust program that allow you to find (not 100% precise) ethereum validators. Please keep in mind this is a 30&rsquo; research in the middle of the night. It&rsquo;s just an experience for demonstration and education ONLY.</p>
<h4 id="cents-about-decentralization-and-client-diversity">Cents about decentralization and client diversity</h4>
<p>Back in the day, BTC guys were almost the same as hackativists. By that I mean, they were truly focused on the mission and the WHY behind the idea of cryptocurrency and electronic cash.
The cypherpunk ideology was fresh and it was very important that the values stated by it were followed.</p>
<p>Time goes by and ETH appears, and what a great project. A full blockchain + a turing complete language that allowed you to create crazy and useful things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With great powers came great responsability - Uncle Ben.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People started to consume, build, talk (bullshits included), and advertise about how awesome all this idea of DECENTRALIZED systems is and they created an industry: WEB3.
The sharks got interested and tons of money starts to arrive for anyone who&rsquo;s building on top of ETH/BTC (and similars) and, surprise surprise the Startup mindset came with it.</p>
<p>Following the startup methodology make sense for prototyping and PoCs but if you&rsquo;re doing DeFi and/or WEB3 related projects you need to be extra cautious because you&rsquo;re dealing with MONEY (!), dealing with people&rsquo;s savings. Ǹo one wants to build a <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/cryptocurrency/what-happened-to-terra/">Terra</a>, right?</p>
<p>So summarizing a little bit, the main ideology got forgoten and the copy-paste era started. People want the money and they&rsquo;re willing to do almost everything to make a quick buck. Lastly, with the copy paste happening, bugs, vulns and other things started to become more and more common.</p>
<h5 id="clients">Clients</h5>
<p>Blockchain make sense because is a cryptography effort to maintain a shared ledger/database where every node (computer that is validating or mining) agrees about its content. To be able to run a node and help the network you need to install a few things and do a little configuration in order to became available for the network.</p>
<p>This process is vital for the network decentralization, security and reliability. The goal is to have as much nodes as possible, running what we call &ldquo;clients&rdquo; and performing all the computations that are needed. The more decentralized we become, the better. As an example, imagine that Europe goes out of scope (or for the non rustaceans: if Europe disapear/goes offline), if our network is decentralized we&rsquo;ll still be able to access the network and get the job done. Basically we&rsquo;re avoiding the &ldquo;single point of failure&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But decentralization comes in many ways, perhaps the most famous one is the &ldquo;geographically distributed&rdquo;, where we have nodes in each corner of the world. Another way is to have multiple clients, multiple softwares that connect you to the blockchain network and allow you to participate in the process. And here is a big, big problem.</p>
<h4 id="client-distribution">Client Distribution</h4>
<p>With almost zero google skills, we can find websites such as: <a href="nodetracker.io">nodetracker.io</a> and <a href="etherscan.io/nodetracker">etherscan.io/nodetracker</a> and you&rsquo;ll see that almost 50% fo the ethereum network uses <a href="geth.ethereum.org">Geth</a> as the client and that 35% of the nodes are located in the US. So I&rsquo;ll demonstrate how we can identify these validators so we can  create bots located closer to them diminishing network latency etc.</p>
<h4 id="reconaissance">Reconaissance</h4>
<p>First we need to create a hypotesis, we need to establish our goal. In order to make things simple I decided to look for the following ports open: 30303 and 9001. The reason behind this is that most of the pools. clients etc use this ports as the default ones in order to establish communication.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>nmap -A -Pn &lt;ip&gt; -p30303,9001
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Once you have all the IPs from a country (roughly speaking and you can use/research about ARIN for the north america case) you can execute the above stated nmap command and see that it will return something close to this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>PORT      STATE SERVICE            VERSION
9001/tcp  open  libp2p-multistream libp2p multistream protocol 1.0.0
30303/tcp open  tcpwrapped
</code></pre><p>You can check for ethereum documentation and learn more about how it uses libp2p <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/p2p-interface.md#transport">here</a></p>
<p>So however it&rsquo;s not bullet proof, this &ldquo;method&rdquo; can help us identify validators. Another option  could be leverage <a href="shodan.io">shodan</a> instead of nmap.</p>
<h4 id="scaling">Scaling</h4>
<p>Ok, so far we did a little experiment and was great. Not ultra fancy but got the job done. Obviously that you&rsquo;ll need more investigation to be sure that it is de facto a validator. Another very important thing is that port scanning is considered hacking &ndash; crime &ndash; in some places, please be careful.</p>
<p>In order to find more validators, we should create a little program that automates the process described about and give us the possible IP addresses.
Is up to you to choose what language and approach to tackle this. You can do a simple and stupid bash script like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a2f;font-weight:bold">for</span> ip in <span style="color:#a2f;font-weight:bold">$(</span>cat list-of-ips.txt<span style="color:#a2f;font-weight:bold">)</span>;<span style="color:#a2f;font-weight:bold">do</span> nmap -Pn -A <span style="color:#b8860b">$ip</span> -p30303,9001;<span style="color:#a2f;font-weight:bold">done</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>For the sake of safety, I&rsquo;ll not share the actual rust code and the full list of IP address that can be found public available on the www. But for you researcher, the idea is the ssame. Just a few more lines of code and an extra google dorks and you&rsquo;re good to go.
Once you get the flow of things, you&rsquo;ll see that there&rsquo;s a lot more things for us to gather, such as OS version, Traceroute to the target address and more. So if you&rsquo;re planning to do some HPT and you&rsquo;re afraid of latency this is a way for you to gather some intelligence and &ndash; maybe &ndash; understand better in what locations you should probably deploy your infrastructure.</p>
<p>Remember that Ethereum is a DarkForest. There&rsquo;s rare animals waiting for an opportunity to exploit and make profits.</p>
