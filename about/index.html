        <p>I&rsquo;m too nerdy for the rockstart, too rock n&rsquo; roll for the nerds. I&rsquo;m an open minded person who tries to challenge the status quo by questioning the obvious things. The WHY drives my curiosity.
In computer science I&rsquo;ve found my passion and was matter of time until I discovered the underground. I&rsquo;ve worked as a programmer for Artificial intelligence companies, as a Security analyst for tradi banks and as a Red teammer for a defense contractor. Most recently I&rsquo;ve joined the mid-nineteenth century black-chambers, the club of those who can keep a secret.</p>
<p>My goals with this enterprise is just to be able to share a little bit of my experience and things that I like to study.It&rsquo;s a big deal for me to share my knowledge with those who share my vision. Here are some of the main topics that this blog should cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Algebra</li>
<li>Cryptology</li>
<li>Reverse Engineering</li>
<li>Open source intelligence</li>
<li>Offensive dark arts</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously is possible that you came across some weird post about some historical event related to one of those topics.. Unfortunately there&rsquo;s nothing I can do about that.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quote to end our little intro:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any. We must come together and create systems which allow anonymous transactions to take place. People have been defending their own privacy for centuries with whispers, darkness, envelopes, closed doors, secret handshakes, and couriers. The technologies of the past did not allow for strong privacy, but electronic technologies do.&rdquo;</p>
